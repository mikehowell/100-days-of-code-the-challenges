### Convert To Camel Case ###

Example from [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/kata/convert-string-to-camel-case)

Complete the method/function so that it converts dash/underscore delimited words into camel casing. 
The first word within the output should be capitalized only if the original word was capitalized.

_Examples_

Kata.ToCamelCase("the-stealth-warrior") // returns "theStealthWarrior"

Kata.ToCamelCase("The_Stealth_Warrior") // returns "TheStealthWarrior"
