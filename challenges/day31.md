### Caesar Cipher - Part 1 ###

Example from [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/AlanBarber/CodeKatas).

Modify the **Encode()** function in the **CaesarCipher** project to encode a string of text using the Caesar Shift Cipher with a provided shift level.

The Caesar Cipher is is a simple alphabet shift cipher in which each letter is replaced with a coresponding encoded letter that is based on a shift number.

Example for a 4 shifted cipher:

    A shifted 4 becomes E
    B shifted 4 becomes F

So as a result you replace every instance of A with E and B with F. Caesar cipher should always return all values in the original case of the input and should not change any non alphabet characters like numbers, spaces or punctuation.

### Caesar Cipher - Part 2 ###

Example from [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/AlanBarber/CodeKatas).

Modify the **Decode()** function in the CaesarCipher project to decode an already encoded string of text back into english with a provided shift level.
